Since the Grammy's were on tonight and I didn't watch them since I was watching coursera lectures, I pulled the list of locations for the Grammy Awards from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Grammy_Award_ceremony_locations) and used them for this leaflet assignment.

Click on the circles to see venue name and number of times hosting.

Don't miss that little circle in Tennessee!

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
df <- read.csv("grammy_loc.csv")
df$popup <- paste(df$popup, df$count, sep = ": ")
df %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(weight = 1, radius = df$count, popup = df$popup)
```
