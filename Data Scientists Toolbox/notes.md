## Week 3

* Types of Analysis
  * Descriptive
  * Exploratory
  * Inferential (infer about population from sample)
  * Predictive (because *X* predicts *Y*, it does not mean that *X* causes *Y*)
  * Causal
  * Mechanistic (exact changes in variable that lead to exact changes in other variables)

* Data: *Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items.*
  * Set of items: Population
  * Variables: A measurement or characteristic of an item

* Experimental Design
  * Look out for confounding. Shoe size > literacy? Yes? No. Age. (Spurious Correlation)
  * Randomizing and blocking - if you can't fix a variable, stratify, if you can't stratify, randomize.
  * Prediction - Key Quantities
    * Sensitivity: Pr ( positive test | disease )
    * Specificity: Pr ( negative test | no disease )
    * Positive Predicted Value: Pr ( disease | positive test )
    * Negative Predicted Value: Pr ( no disease | negative test )
    * Accuracy: Pr ( correct outcome )
  * Data Dredging: Continual modification of the hypothesis until you fit the data
  * Good experiments have replication, measure variability, generalize the problem you care about, and are transparent
  * Prediction is not inference, but both can be important
